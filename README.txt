Pololu Wixel Software Development Kit (SDK)
Modified by Adrien de Croy for dexterity_wixel code used to capture and 
display Dexcom G4 Transmitter packets.
Added dexbridge app that is a modified version of Adrien's 
dexterity_wixel, to accept the Transmitter ID in text and filter 
packets based on this.

This package contains code and Makefiles that will help you create
your own applications for the Pololu Wixel.  The Wixel is a general-
purpose programmable module featuring a 2.4 GHz radio and USB.  The
Wixel is based on the CC2511F32 microcontroller from Texas Instruments,
which has an integrated radio transceiver, 32 KB of flash memory, 4 KB
of RAM, and a full-speed USB interface.

(You can also generate the documentation yourself by running
Doxygen on libraries/Doxyfile.)
